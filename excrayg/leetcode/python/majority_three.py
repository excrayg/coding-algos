# // problem: given an array of n numbers, find the numbers that appears more than floor(n/3) times in the array.
# // e.g.: [1,2] returns [1,2] and [1,1,2] returns 1 and [1,2,3] returns []

l = [1,1,2]

# neat solution! You count every element in l, which makes the time complexity O(mn).
# can you do it better in O(n) time and O(1) space?
# I am not able to think of  something without doing sort or hashmap for this. Any clues?
# below is a demo of majority two, you can think of a similar method
