# swap nodes in pairs

# Question:
# Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head.
# For example,
# Given 1  2  3  4, you should return the list as 2  1  4  3.
# Your algorithm should use only constant space. You may not modify the values in the
# list, only nodes itself can be changed.

class Node:
    def __init__(self, val):
        self.val = val
        self.next = None

def swap_nodes(a):
    dummy = Node(0)
    prev = dummy
    prev.next = a
    a1 = a
    b1 = a.next
